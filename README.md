Took the time to test drive Remix which I have been wanting to for a while.

For the styling used Tailwindscss as it's unmatched when it comes to putting something together quickly and
iterating on it.

As it's a demo decided to focus on what I thought mattered the most like connecting to metamask, fetching and
showing the auctions and giving it a cool design.

It was a bunch of markup, styles and some typescript.

Deployed on netlify at: https://eth-auction.netlify.app/

### Development
